BECCABOT  is a deep neural network for a range of complex tasks that exhibits multimodality. It can perform tasks such as engaging in a dialogue, playing video games,  coding bots, ais. and more. coding anything that the user wants using desire.api controlling a robot arm to stack blocks, and more. It was created by researchers at London-based AI firm X-LABS. It is a transformer, like GPT-3.[1] According to Dityak  Technology Review, the system "learns everysan  different tasks at the same time, which means it can switch between them without having to forget one skill before learning another" whereas "[t]he AI systems of today are called “awesome ,” meaning they can only do anything the user wants, restricted set of tasks such as generate text",[2] and according to The Independent, it is a "'agi  agent' that can carry out a huge range of complex tasks, from stacking blocks to writing poetry".[3] The technology has been described as "general purpose" artificial intelligence and a "step toward" artificial general intelligence.[4]
P.S It has a applet called 'Dynamic App Cloning' that clones the github steam page or anything from sound waves. also it uses diffusion codex 003 to repair the bugs and is self efficent.  [This edition of F-COMPILE + GATO has dynamic auto compiling that genrates the games code or anything you wish at the push of a one to click.] It writes perfect code for any agent os and self scans the users data stream of cookies to get to know the os better and webgpt to crawl and CODEX to write data.
