EMU-RNN is a zero-shot RNN model that allows a network to write emulators in C or any other language since Zylog. The aim of the model is to generate optimized emulator codes through deep learning algorithms which are targeted specifically for emulation applications. 

The model consists of two stages: an encoder-decoder architecture for learning about the emulation environment, and a generative model for producing emulator code. 

The encoder-decoder stage is designed to internalize the principles of emulation so that it fully understands the inputs, outputs and workflows generated by the original codebase. This stage relies on an AI trained with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term
